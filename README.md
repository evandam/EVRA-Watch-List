# EVRA-Watch-List
A way to share and track movies and shows we want to watch

# Getting Started

Get [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Run the following from a terminal:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/evandam/EVRA-Watch-List
cd EVRA-Watch-List
npm install
npm start
```

A browser will open with the page loaded!

If you're editing code, get [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Open it up and then select File > Open Folder, and pick where you cloned `EVRA-Watch-List`.

Open the  integrated terminal (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> on Windows) and run `npm start` to run from there! Changes to the client will update automatically. Changes to the server need the process to be restarted.
