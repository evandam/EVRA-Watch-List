# EVRA-Watch-List
A way to share and track movies and shows we want to watch

# Getting Started

Get [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Also download and install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=tutorials&_ga=2.198273519.1983882865.1528658734-1075290202.1528658733#community) and follow the setup instructions.

Run the following from a terminal:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/evandam/EVRA-Watch-List
cd EVRA-Watch-List
npm install
npm start
```
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the live site!

# Running in Dev
If you're editing code, get [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Open it up and then select File > Open Folder, and pick where you cloned `EVRA-Watch-List`.

Open the  integrated terminal (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> on Windows) and run `npm run dev`. The site will launch automatically, and reload when you modify any code.
